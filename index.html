    <h2> web designing</h2>
    <p>
        Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
        The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design;
         authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; 
         and search engine optimization.
         Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, 
         although some designers will cover them all.
         The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side)
         design of a website including writing markup.

        In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, 
        which later became known as the World Wide Web.
        During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. 
        Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] 
        In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. 
        At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and
         naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as
          images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] 
          The W3C was created in October 1994 to <span>lead the World Wide Web </span>to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.

        <P> Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

         Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building 
        web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS)
         to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.For larger organizations and businesses,
