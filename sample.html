    <p> Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest 
        for readers to scan, but they can also be separated
        by indenting their first lines. This is often used 
        to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.       
        Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school
        papers and rough drafts, uses both blank lines and 
        indentation for separation. In finished works, combining 
        both is considered redundant and amateurish.</p>

<p>
    In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a 
    special character:  the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this
    is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.
